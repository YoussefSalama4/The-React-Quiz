# The-React-Quiz

The **React Quiz** is a quiz application built with React, utilizing the `useReducer` hook to manage all the app's states.

## Features

- **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ):** Start the quiz and preview questions one after another.
- **Answer Validation:** After selecting an answer, the app will indicate whether your answer is correct or not.
- **Progress Tracking:** The app includes a progress bar that updates as you answer each question.
- **Quiz Completion:** The quiz is completed when you either answer all questions or when the time runs out.

## How it Works

1. **Start the Quiz:** Upon starting, the quiz will present one question at a time.
2. **Answer the Question:** Choose your answer, and immediately see whether it's correct or not.
3. **Track Your Progress:** A progress bar at the top of the page keeps track of your progress throughout the quiz.
4. **Complete the Quiz:** The quiz will automatically end either when you've answered all questions or when the allotted time expires.
